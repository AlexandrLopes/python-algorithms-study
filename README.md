# Python Algorithms & Automations Study

Welcome to my Python development journey! This repository serves as a central hub for my coding experiments, algorithm solutions, and automation scripts.

##  Objectives
* Master **Data Structures & Algorithms** (DSA) to write efficient code.
* Automate daily tasks and cloud infrastructure operations using **Python**.
* Document solutions from coding platforms (HackerRank, LeetCode).
* Apply **Clean Code** principles and PEP8 standards.

##  Repository Structure

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **algorithms/** | Implementation of sorting (Bubble, Merge) and searching algorithms. |
| **data-structures/** | Practical examples of Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Trees. |
| **automation/** | Scripts for file manipulation, API requests, and **AWS Boto3** tasks. |
| **challenges/** | Solutions for logic challenges from HackerRank/LeetCode. |
| **00-legacy/** | My early scripts and experiments (keeping track of my evolution). |

##  Technologies & Libraries
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Cloud SDK:** Boto3 (AWS)
* **Testing:** PyTest / Unittest
* **Tools:** PyCharm, Git

##  How to Run
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
You can run any individual script directly from your terminal or IDE:

```bash
# Example
python name_of_script.py
